This thesis explains state of the art Monocular Visual Odometry methods. The selected Visual odometry methods are implemented in software framework. Selected cameras are integrated to a mobile robots after accurate calibration. The algorithms are evaluated with each other and with LiDaR Odometry. The best performing Visual Odometry algorithm is selected for real-time implementation on mobile robot for indoor industrial applications in future work.  \\
