In industrial automation, the market needs reliable and scalable solutions for autonomous transportation in production and logistic processes. To address this need, SICK AG e.g. offers reliable LiDaR localization solutions and a big portfolio of LiDaR sensors. However, the
increased usage of small mobile platforms in swarm applications introduces additional requirements compared to historically bigger autonomous vehicles: The cost factor regarding number and type of used sensor systems increases, the performance of the hardware is limited
and the environment changes.The main target of this work is the investigation, adaption and evaluation of visual Odometry
algorithms for application in mobile swarm robotics.
