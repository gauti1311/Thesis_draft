\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Evaluation criteria}
some criteria  like accuracy(absolute trajectory error), time, efficiency(computation cost), robustness(re-localization), ability to find loop closure, environment condition such as lighting, feature less area.  


\subsection{Comparison}
comparison with LiDaR , ground truth( ?) ...
graphs  of 2D trajectory and results of evaluation parameters.
and selection of best performer. 

\subsection{Observations}
why it works well and why not others
problems with others. 

\subsection{suggestions}
if possible any suggestions for further improvements
