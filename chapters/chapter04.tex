This chapter covers hardware part of the thesis which is camera. Different types of camera and important properties for \acrshort{vo} implementation are explained.


\section{Experimental Setup}

Robot setup figures and homogeneous transformation with details in appendix

\subsection{Proposed Implementation}
explain figures of implementation in software framework. 

\subsection{Data acquisition}

How data is collected and figures of different sequences (with or w/o loop closing etc. ). warehouse setup figures. 
manual or autonomous navigation.

Some conditions or requirements of good data collection e.g. lighting etc. 

\section{Modifications and changes in implementation}
e.g with less features, less RANSAC iteration, window search size, no. of keyframes etc....
with figures.
